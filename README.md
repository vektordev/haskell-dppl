# NeST

This is the code repository for NeST, the Neuro-Symbolic Transpiler.

### <a name="instructions"></a>Instructions

The code herein should compile readily. The intended way of getting your libraries in order is via the haskell tool Stack. You can find it [here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) , or on linux download it like so:

```
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

From there,
```
stack run
```
should run the compiler. Use -- to pass arguments to NeST rather than the build system. You can use

```
stack run -- -i yourCode.spll compile -o output.py -l python
```
to generate python inference code from the code in the input file. 

You can also run the program directly from the command line using the built-in interpreter:

```
stack run -- -i yourCode.spll generate
stack run -- -i yourCode.spll probability -x 0.5
stack run -- -i yourCode.spll integrate -l 0 -h 1
```

to run the program in the forward direction, the prior distribution at x=0.5 and integrate the prior distribution from 0 to 1.

### Using the haskell interface

The functions in [Prelude.hs](src/SPLL/Prelude.hs) provide an easy to use interface for probabilistic programming. The following example declares a program, that represents the sum of two dice, generates a random sample from that program and inferes the probability of that value being produced by the program.

```
showcase :: IO ()
showcase = do
  let twoDice = Program [("main", dice 6 #<+># dice 6)] []
  let conf = CompilerConfig {verbose=0, topKThreshold=Nothing, countBranches=False, optimizerLevel=2}
  gen <- evalRandIO (runGen conf twoDice [])
  putStrLn ("Generated value: " ++ show gen)
  let VTuple (VFloat prob) (VFloat dim) = runProb conf twoDice [] gen
  putStrLn ("Probability of that value occuring: " ++ show prob)
```

You can also decare continuous distributions using the ```uniform``` or ```normal``` functions from [Prelude.hs](src/SPLL/Prelude.hs). The resulting infered probability is then a density instead of a mass. The following example samples from a normal distribution, with a standart deviation of 2 and a mean of 1. Again the program samples one value from this distribution and outputs the probability density for that value.

```
showcase2 :: IO ()
showcase2 = do
  let dist = Program [("main", normal #*# constF 2 #+# constF 1)] []
  let conf = CompilerConfig {verbose=2, topKThreshold=Nothing, countBranches=False, optimizerLevel=2}
  gen <- evalRandIO (runGen conf dist [])
  putStrLn ("Generated value: " ++ show gen)
  let VTuple (VFloat prob) (VFloat dim) = runProb conf dist [] gen
  putStrLn ("Probability density of that value occuring: " ++ show prob)
```

### Examples

The following sections show simple examples that can be compiled and run using SPPL. To do this follow the instructions in section [above](#instructions)

#### MNist Addition

This example constructs a MNist neural network, evaluates it with two different symbols and adds the results

```
neural readMNist :: (Symbol -> Int) of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
main a b = readMNist(a) ++ readMNist(b)
```

#### Recursive lists

The next example creates a unbound list by rolling a 0.5 probability and prepening a normally distributed value to the list if it suceeded.

```
main=if Uniform > 0.5 then [] else Normal:main
```

This example shows off some basic features using algebraic data types:

```
main=(if Uniform>0.5 then left Uniform else right Normal, Uniform)
```


### About

Some of the features of NeST we have described are implemented in a Proof of Concept manner and may not work as intended in all cases. If you believe you have encountered such a case, feel free to reach out or create an issue. Contribuations are of course also welcome.
